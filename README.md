# webdev-1200-exam
Web development group home exam my team and i submitted 25.11.2024. We had 2 months i believe on working on this exam, yet all of us neglected starting it as we were working on other studies at the time. We started 3 weeks before the deadline were the first week was so unproductive, basically all we managed was to make github desktop work (we still had problems with committing and removal/duplication of code but it worked is what matters). Last day I personally worked 14 hours and came to school next day on 3 hours of sleep and worked till the deadline came.

At the end we found out someones push undid footer buttons margin that made it not colide with the text above when collapsed. it wasnt just adding the margin and was something i worked on for 30 minutes so with the deadline 15 minutes away, i chickened out not wanting to take the risk of fixing a small elements bug risking us not getting to submit it because of some server failure that likes to happen last minute.

all in all this turned out much  better than i thought as just a few days prior, the site was not looking close to finished at all because many texts had different margins and it looked inconsistent. thanks to one of our members though who made the margins much better and consistent both on PC and mobile. This was stressful though and we have learned our lesson to not start this late ever again...
